### How to run locally:   

1. Run **"npm install"** in your terminal. In case, if you don't have npm, you have to install npm on your computer.  
2. Then you have set up the **.env** file. Create a .env file and set the value of each key in .env file. So there are basically four keys (PORT
DATABASE_URL,
NODE_DEV
BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS ).<br>
3. Then take a look at the **package.json** file to see the commands.
