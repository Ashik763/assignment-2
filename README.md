### How to run locally:   

1. Run ** "npm install" ** in your terminal. In case, if you don't have npm, you have to install npm on your computer.
2.Then you have set up the .env file. Create a .env file and set the value of each key in .env file. So there are basically four keys (PORT
DATABASE_URL,
NODE_DEV
BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS ).
